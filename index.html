      <div class="c-graph c-graph--languages">
        <p>
          Before all this virus madness happened, Austin and I had planned to get married this coming May 1st.
          Neither of us are big on throwing a huge wedding, but we did want to have a small ceremony on that date, then celebrate 
          later with a much larger group of friends and family. But, as everyone knows, this virus lockdown has
          thrown a wrench in the cogs pretty drastically! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we had wanted a small ceremony anyway, we had to scale back our "small" plan to a "skeleton crew", and
          postpone a large gathering indefinitely. But we miss everyone a lot, and realized this was a unique 
          opportunity to add some excitement and joy to everyone's lives, so we have decided to live stream our
          little backyard ceremony, and hope you are willing to participate with us!
        </p>

      <h3 class="c-card__header">What To Do</h3>
      <p>You will need a laptop or phone to watch. We are doing our best to use google meet, so no extra software will be needed.</p>
      <p>Attire is Semi-Formal, because lord knows we need a reason to dress up these days! <br><small>You can wear PJs if you want, we don't actually care :D</small></small></p>
      <p>Treat yo' self! Get a beverage &amp; dessert to enjoy with us (sorry, we can't mail them to you :( NC won't let us!)</p>
      <p>Take pictures of yourself, or screenshots and share them here: <a class="c-contact" href="http://bit.ly/keener2020album" target="_blank">Shared Wedding Album</a></p></p>
      <p>Let us know if you have any ideas for how we could make this more fun for you! We have never done this before, so ideas are welcome.</p>

      <div class="c-graph c-graph--languages">
        <p>
          Before all this virus madness happened, we had planned to get married this coming May 1st.
          Neither of us are big on throwing a huge wedding, but we did want to have a small ceremony on that date, then celebrate 
          later with a much larger group of friends and family. But, as everyone knows, this virus lockdown has
          thrown a wrench in the cogs pretty drastically! 
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we had wanted a small ceremony anyway, we had to scale back our "small" plan to a "skeleton crew", and
          postpone a large gathering indefinitely. But we miss everyone a lot, and realized this was a unique 
          opportunity to add some excitement and joy to everyone's lives, so we have decided to live stream our
          little backyard ceremony, and hope you are willing to participate with us!
        </p>

      <h3 class="c-card__header">What To Do</h3>
      <p>Make sure you have Zoom installed & ready to go. If you are able to 
        <a href="https://us04web.zoom.us/j/9890661789?pwd=cmRTTUFYOUhjd1hLMkorbUdMZmo5dz09" class="c-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open this link</a>
        and make it to a screen that says "Waiting for Host to Start this meeting" and "Austin Keener's Personal Meeting Room", you've got it working!
      </p>
      <p>The zoom meeting will start at 5pm EST to give everyone plenty of time to be able to get on and make sure everything is
        working smoothly, but <b>the ceremony will begin at 6:30pm EST.</b></p>
      <p>Attire is semi-formal (but honestly, if you want to wear pajamas, we won't judge!)</p>
      <p>The wedding itself will be pretty short and sweet, but we do plan to have a few things happening for the reception:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A cake cutting - get a dessert to eat with us!</li>
        <li>Toasts (nothing official, if you'd like to say something, we will open the floor) - get a beverage to toast with us</li>
        <li>Games - We will be doing a couple of classic wedding games (superlatives, newlyweds game) - be ready to play if you'd like</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Take Pictures & screenshots please!</h3>
      <p>Since this is such a non-traditional experience, 
        we want to see how you all are celebrating! Please take pictures of yourselves and send them to us. 
        We would also love to have screenshots from the wedding & reception, or even of other guests if you are able. 
        We have set up a google photos album to add photos to, but feel free to send them straight to us if this technology eludes you :)
      </p>
